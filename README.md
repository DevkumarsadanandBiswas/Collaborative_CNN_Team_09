Assignment: Fork-Based Collaborative

CNN Development
Cross-Dataset CNN Collaboration Challenge

AI

ML Course Project

Objective
In this assignment, you will work in teams of two to collaboratively design, train, and
evaluate convolutional neural network (CNN) models for the same image classification
task, but using different datasets that cannot be shared.
This project emphasizes:
• Deep learning implementation with PyTorch or TensorFlow

• Full GitHub collaboration workflow (repository creation, forks, branches, pull re-
quests, and issues)

• Cross-domain testing and model comparison
Scenario
You and your teammate are studying the same computer vision problem (e.g., Cats vs
Dogs classification), but each uses a different dataset. Your goal is to build and version
models, test each others work without sharing raw data, and manage all collaboration
through GitHub.
